                Hello, I’m Desi Lee, a software developer with a love for music,
                gardening, cooking, coding and sustainability. I specialise in
                front-end development, focusing on building user-friendly,
                responsive websites and apps. I love working with technologies
                like React, TypeScript, and modern CSS frameworks to create
                responsive and engaging user experiences. Over time, I’ve gained
                experience developing websites and applications that are not
                only functional but also easy on the eye and to navigate. I
                enjoy the challenge of solving problems with clean, efficient
                code and collaborating with teams to bring ideas to life.
                Although front-end development is where I shine, I’m currently
                expanding my knowledge to backend development, diving into Java
                and SQL to become a more well-rounded full-stack developer. I’m
                passionate about continuous learning and improvement, and I love
                exploring new technologies and tools that help make my work even
                better. If you’re looking for someone who thrives on
                collaboration, embraces new challenges, and is always eager to
                learn, feel free to reach out!
            </p>
