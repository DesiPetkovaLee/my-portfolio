## Desi Lee ‚Äì Portfolio (Work in Progress)

A personal portfolio built with React and Vite showcasing my work, skills, and contact information. The design features a two‚Äëtone split Home page with a pendant‚Äëlamp toggle, smooth transitions, and section pages for About, Projects, and Contact.

Live site: `https://desipetkovalee.github.io/my-portfolio/`

### Status

Actively under development. Current focus:
- Responsiveness (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Accessibility (keyboard, semantics, focus, contrast)
- Small UI polish and bug fixes
- Improving styling and colour palette

Over time I‚Äôll migrate more styling logic from SCSS toward component‚Äëscoped React/CSS‚Äëvariables.

## Tech Stack

- React 19 + Vite 7
- React Router DOM 7
- SCSS
- BEM methodology
- Font Awesome
- GitHub Pages
