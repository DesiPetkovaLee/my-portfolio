2 ways to deploy next time—pick the one you prefer.

Option A — keep your current gh-pages flow (manual, super simple)

Do your work on a branch, then merge to main.

From the repo root:

npm install    # only if deps changed
npm run build
npm run deploy

That publishes dist/ to the gh-pages branch (your Pages source).
Then open: https://desipetkovalee.github.io/my-portfolio/?v=now (incognito/hard refresh).

Pro tips

Keep dist/ in .gitignore so it doesn’t clutter main.

If the site looks stale, add ?v=something to the URL or hard refresh.

Option B — set it and forget it (automatic on every push)

If you want zero manual steps:

Add .github/workflows/deploy.yml (the Pages workflow I shared earlier).

In Settings → Pages, set Source = GitHub Actions.

From then on, every push to main auto-deploys. No npm run deploy needed.
